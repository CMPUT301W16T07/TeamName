There is an elastic search database online which stores all profiles and sessions.    
First time running on any device or emulator be sure to go to My Sessions or My Profile    
to run a new profile. The app will save a local file of your profile for future use. 
You must make a unique username. This app follows an MVC object orientated design.    
This app is designed for android devices.

Make sure you have a camera, or enable on on your emulator to use the photograph feature.   
Make sure you enable locations on your device or emulator are enabled.    
connectivity is not required but many features will not be usable without access to the internet.
